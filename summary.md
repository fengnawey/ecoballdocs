# Introduction

## What is Ecoball?

Blockchain is a new comprehensive application model of computer technology such as distributed data storage, point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanism, encryption algorithm, etc. It has the characteristics of decentralization, tamper-proof, openness, and transparency, and joint maintenance. It can not only solve the issue of trust between people in society today, but also a variety of problems and shortcomings that are bothering human society caused by the extreme centralization of the Internet. 

Blockchain technology was first applied to the underlying core technology of the Bitcoin system, and the term "blockchain" was officially defined during the development process. Now it has become one of the most popular words in society. However, since the onset of the Bitcoin system, although blockchain technology has been developed for ten years, it has not yet been massively applied. The reasons are that people have limited knowledge of blockchain and related technologies, and  there is a lack of a blockchain underlying technology platform that is truly universal, compatible, open, safe, and efficient which can provide technical support for the development and operation of the Dapp. In this context, the EcoBall blockchain operating system came into being.

EcoBall is a technologically advanced blockchain operating system. Because of its unique breakthroughs and innovations in technical fields such as cross-chain communication, concurrent processing, distributed storage, and blockchain network system architecture, it can fundamentally solve the constraints the four major problems in the development of blockchain truly realizing large-scale commercial engineering applications of blockchain and meet the needs of blockchain DAPP applications in different scenarios.

The EcoBall ecosystem is composed of EcoBall operating system, EcoBall token economic system, community autonomy model, EcoBall blockchain network cloud system, and many EcoBall blockchain Dapp systems, etc., which are used to build a trustworthy value interconnection of human society. 

To overcome several major challenges brought by blockchain business, EcoBall has independently developed a hybrid consensus algorithm that takes into account fairness and efficiency, multi-chain dynamic integration, and extremely fast cross-chain message routing mechanisms, etc., to build high-performance and highly scalable blockchain operating system platform. 


EcoBall's original design of collaborative smart contract technology, smart contract SDK modularization, and smart contract formal verification technologies greatly reduce the threshold for DAPP development while ensuring the security of blockchain applications. At the same time, EcoBall provides innovative blockchain service systems, such as token economy, domain name services, distributed storage services, etc.

EcoBall is the first public chain in the industry to adopt the GPOW+XPOS hybrid consensus mechanism. It is committed to providing a safe, fast, convenient, and low-cost DEFI application platform. It is fully compatible with EVM and can seamlessly transplant DEFI ecological applications that support EVM while users can enjoy lower handling fees and better user experience.

Besides, EcoBall has also designed a set of flexible cross-chain mechanisms and constructed a universal cross-chain framework to realize cross-chain transactions of multiple digital assets. It will gradually achieve seamless integration with the BTC (Bitcoin) system, ETH (Ethereum) system, and XRP ( Ripple coin) system, EOS (EOS) system, DAG (Directed acyclic graph) system, and other blockchain systems (chains, coins) , effectively breaking the communication barriers between different blockchains, and realizing the diversification of users' digital assets management.

The EcoBall blockchain operating system adopts a layered architecture design, including a core layer, an adaptation layer, and a business layer. The core layer encapsulates the key basic component libraries of the blockchain, including encryption and decryption algorithm libraries, account address management, P2P network components, consensus mechanism libraries, state machines, virtual machines, etc.; the adaptation layer provides APIs, All DAPP applications use the API provided by the adaptation layer to obtain EcoBall blockchain services; the business layer provides an application development platform for a variety of application scenarios, and developers can quickly develop Dapps that meet their own business needs.

## Why Ecoball?

- Fairness and Efficiency Combined

EcoBall adopts GPOW+XPOS hybrid consensus mechanism. POW  currently is the only fairer and more decentralized consensus mechanism that has been verified on a large scale, allowing more people to participate. GPOW has carried out a certain degree of transformation for the unique positioning of EcoBall. XPOS is a modified and optimized version of the POS consensus mechanism. It tries to solve the inherent problems of the traditional POS consensus mechanism and greatly improves the transaction processing efficiency of the system. The TPS can reach about 5000, which basically meets the processing capacity of large-scale commercial applications.

- Lower Participation Threshold

EcoBall uses GPU mining, compatible with all professional GPU mining machines currently on the market, and ordinary home computers equipped with GPU. As long as the Ecoball mining software is run, mining can be performed and native digital tokens can be produced.

- Very low Transaction Fees

EcoBall uses the XPos consensus mechanism to verify and confirm transactions. The transaction confirmation speed is very fast and the transaction fee is very low. It can support large-scale commercial application implementation and wide application of DEFI ecological application. Compared with the expensive gas cost on Ethereum, the cost on EcoBall is almost negligible.

- Higher Security and Scalability

EcoBall uses a unique block generation mechanism to effectively avoid 51% attacks in pure POW mode, forced hard forks, packing empty blocks, and other behaviors that damage the system, while effectively avoiding non-interest-related attacks and long-range attacks in pure POS mode which greatly enhances the security and scalability of the system.

- Compatible with Ethereum and Ecological Applications

EcoBall is fully compatible with the Ethereum EVM. It supports Solidity to write smart contracts, the issuance of digital assets, various DEFI applications, and can seamlessly migrate EVM-compatible DEFI applications to the EcoBall public chain.


## How to join the Ecoball ecosystem?

- Miners

EcoBall mainly has two types of miners, one is GPOW miners and the other is XPOS miners. GPOW miners need to configure a GPU mining machine and run EcoBall mining software to participate in mining and generate revenue. If you are a miner with a large number of mining machines, you can build your own mine or join an existing mine, which is convenient for enjoying lower electricity bills and professional operation and maintenance services. XPOS miners are verification nodes, or verifiers, who need to stake their native tokens and obtain a certain percentage and number of native tokens for voting. For details, please refer to Mining.

- Developers

Developers can build various applications on EcoBall, including physical industrial applications and DEFI applications. Due to compatibility with EVM, various applications that support EVM can be migrated smoothly, expanding their application scope and user groups. For details, please refer to the developer documentation.

- Investors

The native tokens of the EcoBall blockchain have been launched on some exchanges, and investors can go to the exchanges to buy them according to their preferences. To ensure asset security, it is best to use EcoBall digital asset wallet to manage your own assets. You can download the wallet [here](http://www.github.com/ecoballorg/mobilewallet).

- Business Users

Business users are concerned about how to build applications on the blockchain, so that they can use the characteristics of the blockchain to transform their business models and gain a leading market advantage. For details, please refer to various industry solutions.
