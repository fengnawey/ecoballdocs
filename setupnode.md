# setup node


The Ecocall blockchain has two types of nodes. One is the GPoW node, which uses a graphics card to mine and generate a block header. One is the XPOS node, which uses the validation mechanism to validate transactions, construct block bodies and generate blocks. Both types of nodes have separate software systems that need to be installed independently.

## setup GPoW node

GPOW node software is a cross-platform command line program, currently supports Linux, MacOS, Windows three operating system platforms. The installation and deployment methods for the three platforms are basically the same.
